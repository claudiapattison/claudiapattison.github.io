                    <h3>Web Design</h3>
                    <p>I design easy to use user interfaces which are clean and engaging using latest web design trends and techniques. I make sure the most important information stands out on the website. Each design is bespoke and tailored to your needs. I make sure the design looks great on any sized device, from mobile to desktop, creating a multi device experience. </p>

                    <h3>Front End Development</h3>
                    <p>The development phase is when the design comes to life. I build sites that not only good, but are coded and perform at the highest standard. I thrive for the fine details, responsively coded so sites look great on all devices and subtle transitionâ€™s and animations to make the website come to life. Websites are coded to web standards and throughly tested on multiple devices. </p>

                    <h3>CMS Integration </h3>
                    <p>Having a website in a content management system is essential. The benefits in having a website in a CMS is it allows the user to easily add and edit pages on their site, without the need of a developer. I specialise in creating websites in the popular content management system Umbraco and I am a <strong>Umbraco Certified Developer (Level 1)</strong>.</p>
